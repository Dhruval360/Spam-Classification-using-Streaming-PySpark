" there \' s not a trader out there that doesn \' t use enrononline . " as such , enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in which the company \' s credit - worthiness is critical . enron said its business operations were functioning normally yesterday . the company also has consistently said it is financially strong and liquid .\nenron said its new chief financial officer is jeffrey mcmahon , the 40 - year - old head of the company \' s industrial - markets division . his selection may be intended , in part , to raise the company \' s credibility . people familiar with the matter say mr . mcmahon left his job as treasurer last year after voicing concerns within the company about mr . fastow \' s role in running two limited partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transactions with enron . internal partnership documents indicate mr . fastow and possibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnerships . mr . fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in july in the face of increasing conflict - of - interest concerns being expressed by wall street analysts and major enron investors . on monday , enron announced that the securities and exchange commission was looking into the fastow - related transactions .\nwhile enron as recently as tuesday strongly defended mr . fastow , as well as the company \' s dealings with the partnerships , controversy over those arrangements clearly played a role in the executive \' s departure . " in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , " said chairman and chief executive kenneth lay in a prepared statement .\nenron said mr . fastow " will be on a leave of absence from the company . " he couldn \' t be reached for comment .\nit remains to be seen how much mr . fastow \' s removal will assuage an increasingly restive investment community . the action came after the 4 p . m . market close and followed a day in which enron \' s stock once again plunged . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading , enron shares were at $ 16 . 41 , down $ 3 . 38 , or 17 % . it topped the big board \' s most active list at nearly 76 million shares , more than twice the volume of the second - most - active stock . several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800 , 000 shares or more , possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on enron stock .\nenron \' s shares are down about 50 % from the beginning of last week . earlier this year , the stock was above $ 80 a share .\nin an apparent ripple effect , the stocks of other energy - trading companies , which do business with enron , also fell sharply yesterday . for instance , dynegy inc . shares on the big board were off $ 5 . 45 , or 13 % , at $ 37 . 26 . a number of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies much different than enron \' s , which rely heavily on complex and highly structured investment vehicles .\nprudential securities analyst carol coale said mr . fastow \' s departure could be seen as evidence that " management does care " about investor concerns . however , she adds , the move also could be viewed by some investors , coming as it did two days after the announcement of the sec inquiry , as " an admission of guilt . " ms . coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on enron largely because of uncertainties about the company \' s extremely complex financial structure .\nenron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its fastow - related dealings .\nworries and rumors about enron \' s financial strength could be found in the stock market yesterday . goldman sachs analyst david fleischer said he heard people voice concerns about a possible " death spiral " in which increasing credit concerns about enron would decrease the number of people willing to do business with the company , which would in turn weaken its finances and lead to further business reductions . mr . fleischer , a longtime fan who still has a buy recommendation on the company , said he hasn \' t yet seen any evidence of such a problem .\nhowever , mr . fleischer said , enron needs to disclose more information about its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other entities . enron is facing a problem with " trust and credibility . it \' s not easy to regain something as basic as trust , " he said .\ncopyright ?

quarter earnings on oct 16 .\nthe earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analysts had already expressed displeasure at : fastow , with the approval of enron \' s board , had formed and run two investment partnerships - - ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment .\nthe partnerships , which did complex financing and hedging deals with enron , served as a source of funding for enron projects and investments .\nbut wall street questioned how fastow could watch out for the interests of enron \' s shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time .\nso fastow , in june , resigned his roles at the partnerships and enron also ended its relationships with the ljm entities . during the third -

"\nthe enron spokesman said yesterday that the company \' s trading partners are doing business with enron on " essentially the same terms " as they have in the past . " there has been no significant change in the credit conditions , " he said . trading partners demanding significantly stricter terms from enron would be a sign of further deteriorating confidence in the energy giant \' s finances .\nthe banks involved in the current negotiations , including j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . , are asking enron for stricter covenants on the new credit line than they had asked for in the past , one official said .\nbankers involved with the company say the goal of the new credit line is to show the investment community that enron can meet its commitments . " confidence in this company was lost , " said one bank official involved in the negotiations for a new credit line . " but confidence will be restored . "\ncorporations of enron \' s size commonly establish credit lines only to demonstrate to the investment community that in case of an emergency , they have access to cash . in practice , few companies actually make use of these lines . thus , drawing down credit lines , while providing immediate cash , also illustrates the pressure enron is feeling .\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .\nmanager \' s journal : how enron ran out of gas\nby paul kedrosky\n10 / 29 / 2001\nthe wall street journal\na 22\n( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )\nis troubled enron corp . the long term capital management of the energy markets , or merely yet another mismanaged company whose executives read too many of their own press releases ? or is poor enron just misunderstood ? those are the questions after another week of chinese water torture financial releases from the beleaguered houston - based energy concern .\na year ago enron was the hottest of the hot . while tech stocks were tanking , enron \' s shares gained 89 % during 2000 . even die - hard enron skeptics - - of which there are many - - had to concede that last year was a barnburner for the company . earnings were up 25 % , and revenues more than doubled .\nnot bad , considering where the company came from . a decade ago 80 % of enron \' s revenues came from the staid ( and regulated ) gas - pipeline business . no longer . enron has been selling those assets steadily , partly fuelling revenues , but also expanding into new areas . by 2000 , around 95 % of its revenues and more than 80 % of its profits came from trading energy , and buying and selling stakes in energy producers .\nthe stock market applauded the move : at its peak , enron was trading at around 55 times earnings . that \' s more like cisco \' s once tropospheric valuation than the meager 2 . 5 times earnings the market affords enron competitor duke energy .\nbut enron management wanted more . it was , after all , a " new economy " web - based energy trader where aggressive performers were lucratively rewarded . according to enron chairman and ceo ken lay , the company deserved to be valued accordingly . at a conference early this year he told investors the company \' s stock should be trading much higher - - say $ 126 , more than double its price then .\nthen the new economy motor stalled . the company \' s president left under strange circumstances . and rumors swirled about enron \' s machinations in california \' s energy markets . investors pored over enron \' s weakening financial statements . but enron analysts must have the energy and persistence of talmudic scholars to penetrate the company \' s cryptic financials . in effect , enron \' s troubles were hiding in plain sight .\nit should have been a warning . because of the poor financial disclosure there was no way to assess the damage the economy was doing to the company , or how it was trying to make its numbers . most analysts blithely concede that they really didn \' t know how enron made money - - in good markets or bad .\nnot that enron didn \' t make money , it did - - albeit with a worrisomely low return on equity given the capital required - - but sometimes revenues came from asset sales and complex off - balance sheet transactions , sometimes from energy - trading revenues . and it was very difficult to understand why or how - - or how likely it was enron could do it again next quarter .\nenron \' s financial inscrutability hid stranger stuff . deep inside the company filings was mention of ljm cayman , l . p . , a private investment partnership . according to enron \' s march 2000 10 - k , a " senior officer of enron is the managing member " of ljm . well , that was a puzzler . ljm was helping enron " manage price and value risk with regard to certain merchant and similar assets by entering into derivatives , including swaps , puts , and collars . " it was , in a phrase , enron \' s house hedge fund .\nthere is nothing wrong with hedging positions in the volatile energy market - - it is crucial for a market - maker . but having an enron executive managing and benefiting from the hedging is something else altogether , especially when the enron executive was the company \' s cfo , andrew fastow . while he severed his connection with ljm ( and related partnerships ) in july of this year - - and left enron in a whirl of confusion last week - - the damage had been done .\nas stories in this paper have since made clear , mr . fastow \' s ljm partnership allegedly made millions from the conflict - ridden , board - approved ljm - enron relationship . and recently enron ended the merry affair , taking a billion - dollar writedown against equity two weeks ago over some of ljm \' s wrong - footed hedging . analysts , investors , and the securities & exchange commission were left with many questions , and very few answers .\nto be fair , i suppose , enron did disclose the ljm arrangement more than a year ago , saying it had erected a chinese wall between fastow / ljm and the company . and in a bull market , no one paid much attention to what a bad idea that horribly conflicted relationship was - - or questioned the strength of the wall . now it matters , as do other enron - hedged financings , a number of which look to have insufficient assets to cover debt repayments due in 2003 .\nwe didn \' t do anything wrong is mr . lay \' s refrain in the company \' s current round of entertainingly antagonistic conference calls . that remains to be seen , but at the very least the company has shown terrible judgment , and heroic arrogance in its dismissal of shareholders interests and financial transparency .\nwhere has enron \' s board of directors been through all of this ? what kind of oversight has this motley collection of academics , government sorts , and retired executives exercised for enron shareholders ? very little , it seems . it is time enron \' s board did a proper investigation , and then cleaned house - - perhaps neatly finishing with themselves .\n- - -\nmr . kedrosky is a professor of business at the university of british colombia .\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones section a\nenron seeks additional financing\nby richard a . oppel jr .\n10 / 29 / 2001\nthe new york times\npage 9 , column 4\nc . 2001 new york times company\ndallas , oct . 28 - - the enron corporation , still struggling to reassure investors it can weather a financial crisis over complicated transactions involving its former chief financial officer , is seeking $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion in additional financing from banks , an industry official said today .\nlast week , enron , the nation \' s largest energy - trading concern , used about $ 3 billion in available credit lines and spent about $ 2 billion to pay off commercial paper . now , by obtaining even more financing , enron is hoping to convince investors and other energy - trading firms that it will not face a cash squeeze that could lead trading partners to refuse to extend credit or do business with it .\nenron \' s board , which has been holding meetings by telephone over the last two weeks to monitor the company \' s financial situation , held another meeting this afternoon . \' \' the board is meeting frequently and will announce any actions when appropriate , \' \' an enron spokesman said .\ntwo weeks ago , enron disclosed that its shareholder equity had been reduced by $ 1 . 2 billion because of deals with investment partnerships involving its former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who was ousted last week . the company also disclosed about $ 1 billion in separate write - offs , and it said last week that the securities and exchange commission had made an inquiry into its financial accounting .\nenron hopes to maintain its investment - grade credit rating , which is crucial to ensuring that other energy traders continue to do business with it . lately , enron \' s bonds have been trading at prices more like junk bonds , and two major credit -

wheeling management , write simon london and sheila mcnulty .\nenron has some explaining to do . for the past decade or more , the texas - based company has basked in the admiration of investors and business school professors eager to understand its transformation from staid utility to fast - growing energy trader . now it faces scrutiny of a more unwelcome kind .\nits share price has been falling since the beginning of this year . the us securities and exchange commission is investigating multi - million dollar deals with a private equity fund associated with its own chief financial officer , which resulted in a $ 1 . 2 bn reduction in shareholders \' equity . a hastily - convened conference call last week with analysts raised as many questions as it answered about these " related - party transactions " . the departure of andy fastow , the aforementioned cfo , soon followed .\nwith its credit rating under review by two leading ratings agencies , enron has also been forced to draw down bank credit lines . yesterday if confirmed it was trying to establish additional lines of liquidity .\n" this marks the end of enron \' s walk on the wild side , " observes curt launer , an analyst with credit suisse first boston , the investment bank .\non the surface , events at enron can be explained by the combination of deteriorating trading conditions , a complex capital structure and poor investor relations . but the root causes go back further . the entrepreneurial culture and dynamic management that fuelled enron \' s growth in the 1990 s appear to have also sown some of the seeds of the present crisis . therein may lie a cautionary tale for all executives trying to sprinkle " new economy " magic on to old economy companies .\nenron \' s transformation began in earnest in 1990 with the arrival of jeffrey skilling , who was hired from mckinsey , the management consulting firm , to develop energy trading .\nfor the previous decade enron had been emerging as a force in the deregulating us energy markets under the guidance of kenneth lay , a former deputy under - secretary of energy . mr lay remains chairman . but it was mr skilling who spearheaded the move into trading energy as well as generating and supplying it .\nthe two sides of the business - trading and generation / supply - have always been strange bedfellows . the former demands an entrepreneurial spirit more likely to be found on wall street than in a utility . mr skilling \' s answer in the early 1990 s was to bring in talent from outside the company . one of his first recruits was mr fastow , an expert in securitisation , the repackaging of financial assets so they can be traded in financial markets .\nthe energy trading division tried from the start to differentiate itself . a management structure was introduced with only four layers - vice - president , director , manager and associate / analyst - much like a consulting firm . employees were free to take as much holiday as they liked , so long as they delivered results . as one of mr skilling \' s early recruits recalled : " it was all about creating an atmosphere and deliberately breaking the rules . "\nthe seemingly free - wheeling style was based on a " loose - tight " management model expounded by tom peters and bob waterman , the management writers and mckinsey alumni . at enron this meant that employees in the merchant energy business were encouraged by huge bonuses to pursue new ideas and innovate in existing markets .\nup - and - coming employees moved freely between projects in pursuit of glory . louise kitchen , the 32 - year - old british executive who was the creative force behind enron online , the group \' s internet - based trading platform , changed jobs or was promoted seven times in five years .\nbalancing these loose management practices were tight central control of risk , legal commitments , finance and performance evaluation / remuneration . mr skilling once described the approach in this way : " as long as you clear your deals or business ideas through those screens , you can do whatever you want around here . "\nthis approach did deliver growth and innovation . as well as making markets in its core energy products , enron now trades everything from weather derivatives - which enable companies to insure themselves against unfavourable climatic conditions - to broadband telecommunications capacity and metals . the success of enron online allows the group to describe itself as the world \' s leading e - commerce company .\nit has also started marketing electricity to us consumers through a joint venture with international business machines and america online , the internet service provider .\nin february this year mr skilling got his reward : he became chief executive of a group ranked seventh in fortune magazine \' s list of the 500 most powerful us corporations - ahead of such corporate giants as ibm , at & t , bank of america and boeing .\nin retrospect , however , this breakneck pace of growth and innovation was achieved at a price . first was the personal cost to mr skilling . in august he abruptly resigned after only six months in the top job . personal , non - health related reasons were cited and investors have received no further explanation .\na second cost was an enormous increase in financial complexity . in order to avoid a ballooning of assets and liabilities as the group expanded , enron used a range of off - balance sheet vehicles to help finance expansion . ljm , the private equity fund in which mr fastow played a role , is just one of a cast of characters to be found in the footnotes to enron \' s accounts . other financing vehicles include osprey , marlin , whitewing , atlantic water trust and azurix . " they went after too many things too quickly , " says stephen moore of moody \' s investors service , the credit ratings agency .\na third cost , associated with the last , was a loss of financial transparency . the group \' s extensive use of swaps , options and other derivative financial instruments in its merchant energy business means that investors have little idea of how enron actually makes its money - or the underlying risks to which it is exposed .\ndavid fleischer , an analyst at goldman sachs , summed up the views of many investors during last week \' s conference call . he told the group \' s management : " the company \' s credibility is being severely questioned and there is a need for much more disclosure . there is an appearance that you are hiding something or that there is something going on beneath the surface that may be questionable . "\nthe fourth cost was a loss of strategic focus . " the problems , in our view , stem from enron venturing too aggressively in areas outside of its core skills , " argues raymond niles , analyst at salomon smith barney . " power plants in india , water companies , extension of their franchise to the mass retail market , and using a fibre - optic network to deliver content over the internet are all unrelated , or only tangentially related , to their core merchant energy business . "\nenron executives also appeared to get carried away with the prospects for some of these ventures . this time last year mr skilling was arguing that enron broadband was a business worth $ 35 bn ( # 24 bn ) in its own right . this helped push the share price to all - time highs - and storing up trouble when trading volumes failed to materialise .\n" they over - promised on the new business they created , " says chris bartlett , a professor at harvard business school and long - time watcher of the company . " enron was trying to ride the dotcom bubble with enron online and the broadband business . to some extent they are now paying the price . "\nwill enron weather the storm ? notwithstanding the risk of further out - of - the - blue financial shocks , most analysts believe that it will . the merchant energy business remains powerful and profitable . mr niles at salomon smith barney points out that this side of the group drives more than 80 per cent of earnings and has shown consistent 30 - 40 per cent annual growth over the past three years . assets totalling more than $ 4 bn were also earmarked for disposal before the current crisis erupted , underlining that there is plenty of realisable value within the group \' s portfolio of physical energy assets .\nand yet the doubts remain . it is , ultimately , a question of confidence and credibility . investors suspect that the balance between loose and tight management methods has tilted too far towards the former . mr lay and his team will have to tighten up .\n( c ) copyright financial times ltd . all rights reserved .\nhttp : / / www . ft . com .\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .\nfront page - companies & markets - enron asks banks for additional credit .\nby sheila mcnulty and gary silverman .\n10 / 29 / 2001\nfinancial times\n( c ) 2001 financial times limited . all rights reserved\nenron , the troubled us energy group , was attempting yesterday to persuade banks to provide additional credit to bolster its position after a sharp fall in its share price .\nthe houston - based company was also due last night to hold a special board meeting to consider confidence - building measures after surprise financial disclosures damaged its reputation among us investors .\nlast week the company raised $ 3 . 3 bn ( euros 3 . 7 bn ) in cash to bolster its financial position but enron admitted yesterday that it was still looking for additional finance . the company insisted , however , that it was in good financial health and that its core energy trading business remained strong .\nmark palmer , an enron spokesman , said he hoped the company would have something to announce in coming days from its latest effort to " establish additional lines of liquidity " . " once we are able to get the liquidity position shored up , that will put a lot of fears of the unknown to rest , " mr palmer said .\nthe company \' s problems have become public since an announcement on october 16 that it would take a $ 1 . 01 bn special charge and write down shareholders \' equity by another $ 1 . 2 bn . the moves followed losses arising from a private equity operation run by andrew fastow , its former chief financial officer , who was forced to take a leave of absence last week .\nenron \' s share price has fallen more than 50 per cent since the october 16 announcement and its bonds have been trading at levels that are technically " junk " status , though its official ratings are still investment grade .\n" our concern is that a reduction in the debt rating could impair their ability to operate their trading and marketing operations , " said raymond niles of salomon smith barney .

mighty enron strains under scrutiny\nby alex berenson and richard a . oppel jr .\n10 / 28 / 2001\nthe new york times\npage 1 , column 2\nc . 2001 new york times company\nis time running out for enron ?\nat the beginning of this year , the enron corporation , the world \' s dominant energy trader , appeared unstoppable . the company \' s decade - long effort to persuade lawmakers to deregulate electricity markets had succeeded from california to new york . its ties to the bush administration assured that its views would be heard in washington . its sales , profits and stock were soaring .\nand under the leadership of jeffrey k . skilling , its chief executive , enron \' s arrogance had grown even more quickly .\nthe company , based in houston , dripped contempt for the regulators and consumer groups that stood between it and fully deregulated markets - - for electricity , water and everything else . everyone would win under deregulation , enron said - - especially its shareholders , whose stock would soar as the company profited from creating new markets .\n\' \' we are on the side of angels , \' \' mr . skilling said in march , dismissing those who saw the company as a profiteer in california \' s energy crisis . \' \' people want to have open , competitive markets . they want fair competition . it \' s the american way . \' \'\nbut less than a year later , everybody seems to have lost , especially enron \' s investors . enron \' s stock is plunging , and questions about its finances are mounting .\nsome experts in the energy industry worry that if the crisis at the company worsens , trading in natural gas and electricity could be seriously disrupted and energy prices could grow more volatile . in a worst - case outlook , enron could become the 2001 version of long - term capital management , the huge hedge fund whose collapse roiled financial markets during the fall of 1998 . enron \' s shares have fallen more than 80 percent this year , erasing $ 50 billion in shareholder value .\nenron closed on friday at $ 15 . 40 , down 95 cents , after hitting a 52 - week low of $ 15 . 04 earlier in the day .\nthe future of electricity deregulation is in doubt , thanks to blackouts and soaring power prices in california earlier this year - - a crisis that ended only when that state contradicted deregulation \' s basic tenets by intervening deeply in the power market . enron \' s efforts to become a profit - making water supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capacity have been expensive failures . in august , mr . skilling quit , forcing kenneth l . lay , his predecessor as chief executive and still enron \' s chairman , to resume day - to - day control of the company .\nthe company declined to make senior executives , including mr . lay , available for comment , and asked that questions be submitted in writing . mr . skilling could not be reached .\nenron \' s problems boiled over earlier this month , when it disclosed that its shareholders \' equity , a measure of the company \' s value , dropped by $ 1 . 2 billion in the last quarter because of a deal disclosed only very hazily in enron \' s regular financial statements . the securities and exchange commission is looking into the company \' s financial reporting , and some investors question whether enron has overstated profits at its primary business of trading electricity and natural gas .\nthe slump in the company \' s shares accelerated after enron revealed the fall in its shareholders \' equity . on wednesday , the company forced out its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who is at the center of the controversy over enron \' s confusing finances . the company , which six months ago seemed to be reaping billions of dollars from california \' s energy crisis , today faces a potential cash crunch .\nthe surprise about shareholder equity inflamed investors \' smoldering concern about enron \' s opaque financial statements . now , with wall street analysts and bond - rating agencies demanding more information about the complex transactions that have fueled the company \' s profits , enron has been reduced to issuing news releases assuring investors that it has adequate access to cash .\nenron does not appear to be in immediate danger of running out of cash . on thursday , the company drew down a $ 3 . 3 billion credit line it had previously arranged with a group of banks led by citigroup and j . p . morgan chase , which have each extended at least $ 400 million . but because of enron \' s importance in the natural gas and electricity markets , industry experts say that any problem at the company could disrupt energy trading nationwide .\nthe supply of natural gas and electricity would probably not be affected even if the company failed , because enron is mainly a trader , rather than a producer , of energy . but a crisis at the company might increase the volatility of energy prices , which have swung wildly in the last year .\nphilip k . verleger jr . , an energy - markets economist , emphasized that he thought enron would survive this crisis . but he said it was not clear what would happen if enron ran out of cash or if traders that use the company \' s enrononline internet trading marketplace defaulted on their obligations .\n\' \' you suddenly have all these positions they have taken on there - - are they good ? are the firm \' s hedges good ? what \' s the situation ? \' \' mr . verleger said . \' \' it \' s got everyone scared . \' \'\nin the short run , enron \' s credit rating may be its biggest problem . if the company \' s rating falls below investment grade , enron could be forced to issue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover loans that it has guaranteed . but creating new shares would make the shares that already exist less valuable , because those shares would no longer represent full ownership of the company .\na drop in the company \' s credit rating could also prompt other energy traders and producers to back away from doing business with enron , hurting the company \' s sales and profits .\nenron \' s credit rating stands several notches above the critical point . but its bonds , which are publicly traded , have fallen so low that they are now offering interest rates of almost 10 percent , comparable with many junk bonds . two of the three major credit - rating agencies , moody \' s investors service and fitch investors service , have put enron \' s bonds on review for possible downgrades .\n\' \' the issue that \' s in the front of everybody \' s mind right now is credit , \' \' said mark gurley , senior vice president and general manager for trading at aquila inc . , one of the nation \' s largest energy traders . aquila is based in kansas city , mo .\nfor now , aquila and other major energy traders and producers , including reliant energy , the el paso corporation and dynegy , are continuing to do business with enron . and mr . gurley said that enron \' s own trading in the electricity and natural gas markets did not suggest the sort of frenzied selling reminiscent of the collapse of long - term capital management in 1998 .\n\' \' they haven \' t done anything trading - wise that gives me any indication they are closing their books down , \' \' he said .\nstill , some executives at other companies said they were looking more carefully at transactions with enron , especially long - term contracts . they also said risk - management and credit officers were calling each other regularly to discuss the situation .\nmark palmer , an enron spokesman , said on friday that no energy - trading company had stopped doing business with enron . he declined to say whether any of the company \' s trading partners had suspended or altered credit terms . he said the company was continuing to see normal volumes of business .\nbut the crisis that enron will face if its credit rating is downgraded is just a symptom of the bigger problem the company must confront . for years , the details of enron \' s finances have been a mystery even to the wall street analysts whose job it is to follow the company , and to the investors who own its stock and bonds . when enron \' s profits were soaring and it was creating lucrative new markets , shareholders did not seem to care about the impenetrability of its financial statements .\nnow they do . yet the company seems incapable of offering straight answers to the questions investors ask .\nto others in the industry , the opaqueness of the company \' s financial statements parallels enron \' s efforts to keep its energy - trading business lightly regulated and free of disclosure requirements . though they do not expect enron to crumble like long - term capital management , they say that , like the giant hedge fund , enron uses a lot of debt , regulatory oversight is limited and outsiders have a difficult time figuring out its finances .\nthe most pressing concerns are a series of partnerships and trusts enron created to move some of its assets and debt off its balance sheet . with names like marlin and osprey , the partnerships have at least $ 3 . 3 billion in bonds outstanding , backed by assets like a stake in azurix , enron \' s water company subsidiary . enron has promised that if the partnerships \' debts exceed the value of their assets , enron will issue enough new shares to make up the difference .\ndeals with partnerships formed by mr . fastow , who was chief financial officer when they were organized , led to the $ 1 . 2 billion write - off in shareholders \' equity that enron announced last week . the company has offered only skimpy details of its transactions with those partnerships .\nenron ended its relationships with those partnerships in the last quarter , after being criticized by shareholders . in the process , it wrote off a promissory note that it had carried on its books , reducing its shareholders \' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion . but , because of complex accounting rules , the transaction was not apparent in enron \' s quarterly earnings report .\nthe transaction disturbs investors because it suggests that enron may have found a way to hide losses , throwing the accuracy of its financial statements into question . when enron released third - quarter earnings on oct . 16 , it reported a loss from $ 1 billion in write - offs on failed investments . the earnings statement did not mention the additional $ 1 . 2 billion equity write - down . but the company said its core business had been solidly profitable , and its shares rose .\nin a conference call with analysts after the announcement , mr . lay , enron \' s chairman , also disclosed the reduction in shareholder equity . the reference was a brief one , however , and some listeners did not catch it . those analysts were angered when they found out the next day what enron had done , and many were confused by the accounting procedure . enron \' s stock began to slide , and investors clamored for more information about the write - off . but so far , the company \' s efforts to clear up the situation have further unnerved investors .\nmr . lay has met with investors during the last two weeks to try to explain the deals , but some on wall street say they have come away with doubts about mr . lay \' s grasp of the situation . they say that the two people at enron who appear to have been most knowledgeable about the deals - - mr . skilling and mr . fastow - - have both left the company .\nin an interview in late august , mr . lay said he did not know some details about the deals involving mr . fastow . in response to one question about them , he said , \' \' you \' re getting way over my head . \' \'\nmr . palmer of enron disputed any suggestion that mr . lay did not have a grasp of the investments at issue , saying mr . lay was handicapped in talking about them because of the s . e . c . investigation . \' \' there is not a whole lot we can say , or should say , about them , \' \' mr . palmer said . he also said the company expected to generate about $ 3 billion in cash through asset sales by the end of next year .\nin a conference call on tuesday , analysts pressed mr . lay and other top enron executives to reveal more information about the ljm write - down and its other partnerships . instead , they offered only vague explanations of the deal , leaving wall street worried that more write - offs might be coming .\ndavid fleischer , a goldman , sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the company , was among those who came away concerned . \' \' if enron is unable to clarify its off - balance - sheet transactions and restore confidence in the very near term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming that would affect the balance sheet or liquidity position , then the company will likely lose access to the capital markets , \' \' he wrote in a research note after the call .\nto try to reassure investors , enron said late thursday that enrononline , its internet - based trading exchange , executed more than 8 , 400 trades that day , a higher - than - normal volume .\n\' \' we know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community - - and we \' re working on that , \' \' mr . lay said in a statement . \' \' but in the meantime , the best evidence of our strength is the willingness of customers to bring their business to enron . \' \'\nbut those reassurances apparently are no longer enough for wall street . enron \' s stock tumbled almost 6 percent friday , to its lowest levels in six years .\nnow analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of enron \' s off - balance - sheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new shares to make good on its partnership guarantees .\ncarol coale , an analyst at prudential securities in houston , calculates that enron may have close to $ 9 billion in off - balance - sheet debt . she said that enron had for two years been trying to sell about $ 6 billion in foreign assets - - including properties in latin america and a power plant in india embroiled in a dispute with the state government - - and she worries about those prospects for sale in light of enron \' s problems and the souring economy .\n\' \' as enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their backs , they may have to write those assets down , \' \' ms . coale said . on wednesday , she downgraded her rating on enron to \' \' sell \' \' from \' \' neutral . \' \'\n\' \' the bottom line is , it \' s really difficult to recommend an investment when management does not disclose the facts , \' \' ms . coale said .\nshort - sellers , who attacked enron \' s accounting even before the company disclosed the write - off , say the company \' s problems may run even deeper than analysts fear . enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance money - losing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business , they say .\n\' \' the company still isn \' t disclosing enough to know whether the core business , the trading business , is profitable , \' \' said mark roberts , director of research at off wall street , which recommended shorting enron \' s stock on may 7 , when it stood at $ 59 . 43 . \' \' the issue remains : why are they doing these transactions ? our theory has been that the core operations aren \' t that profitable . \' \'\njames chanos , a leading short - seller who has bet that enron \' s stock will fall , said , \' \' is enron booking gains when it has real profits , but hiding the losses when deals go against it ? \' \' mr . palmer of enron said the company stood by its reported energy - trading profits .\neven traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture of enron \' s positions . enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wiped out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its trading book balanced - - meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset , in roughly equivalent amounts , by energy it has agreed to buy .\n\' \' with these guys , they tell us - - and all you \' ve got is their word - - that they \' re hedged , \' \' said mr . verleger , the economist .\nin fact , enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation and disclosure of its trading operations . last year , the company successfully lobbied congress to effectively ensure that its internet - trading platform would be exempted from regulation by the commodity futures trading commission .\nenron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the federal energy regulatory commission , the agency that oversees wholesale electricity and natural gas markets . but the commission does not keep track of specific transactions and prices .\nlarge - scale energy trading has existed for only about a half - dozen years . enron pioneered the business , and now dominates it , accounting for about one - quarter of all trading in the united states .\nbefore congress and federal regulators opened up the market for wholesale electricity , a process that began in earnest a decade ago , the power business was a simpler affair . utilities were given areas of monopoly service , and their rates - - and ability to deliver enough electricity - - were overseen by state regulators . but with the move to deregulate the business , independent and unregulated generators and traders have flourished , providing an ever - growing portion of the nation \' s power .\nbeginning in the 1980 \' s , the sale and transportation of natural gas was also deregulated , spurring enron , which used to be primarily a gas - pipeline company , to move into the trading business .\nthe company \' s shift to trading gas and electricity accelerated in the mid - 1990 \' s , with the ascension of mr . skilling , who became chief executive in february , just six months before his unexpected resignation . underscoring the change in direction , in securities filings this year enron described its principal business as \' \' security brokers , dealers and flotation . \' \' before , it had said it was in the business of \' \' wholesale - petroleum and petroleum products . \' \'\nfor most of its ascent , enron reported outstanding profit figures and wall street accepted them with pleasure . a year ago , when it disclosed the first transactions with partnerships led by mr . fastow , the company \' s former chief financial officer , analysts who asked questions were told that the deals were routine and were being disclosed only because of mr . fastow \' s involvement .\nenron does not appear to face an immediate cash crunch . but the bank credit lines that it drew on last week to pay off its short - term debt will have to be renegotiated next spring . the controversial partnerships do not have to pay their debts until the following year - - unless enron loses its investment - grade credit rating before that .\nenron will also need to maintain its large trading positions , which could suffer if participants in those markets grow more nervous about enron \' s credit . when long - term capital was stumbling in 1998 , some wall street rivals sold the securities they thought long - term owned , trying to force long - term to sell its positions quickly and at a loss . something similar in energy markets might be possible . if so , enron might find , as long - term did , that positions that should offset each other do not .\nenron \' s new chief financial officer may yet persuade investors that in fact the company \' s profits are real , and that its condition is better than the short - sellers believe . as questions are answered , confidence , and the share price , could rebound .\nbut for now , investors are skittish , and some competitors are eager to take advantage of enron \' s plight .\nphotos : enron , which is building a new headquarters in houston , grew with deregulation . but with deregulation in doubt , enron stock has dropped .

"\nenron \' s most recent woes began oct . 16 when its third - quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about : then - chief financial officer andrew fastow , with the enron board \' s approval , had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest .\nthe partnerships , ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment , did complex financing and hedging deals with enron and were formed originally as a way to offset risks associated with some of the company \' s newer businesses such as broadband trading .\nfastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when wall street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of enron \' s shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously . but last week when the company reported a $ 35 million loss related to ending its ljm ties as well as a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity , new questions began to arise .\nthe securities and exchange commission \' s division of enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships , and earlier this week fastow was put on a leave of absence .\nnow enron will begin repurchasing its commercial paper . this is a way for companies to raise money over a short period at rates that are usually slightly better than what banks offer , and often with more flexible terms .\n" to some extent , redeeming the commercial paper is at the expense of the capital markets , which look at it negatively , " said anatol feygin , an analyst with j . p . morgan .\nbut reducing the company \' s debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools , like a revolving line of credit , could give great peace of mind to enron \' s investors , he said .\n" it helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business , which is really the core of their operations , " feygin said .\ncarol coale , an analyst with prudential securities , still sees the move as somewhat confusing .\n" just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus , but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange , mixed message , " she said . " do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back ? is it a gesture for customers ? it first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management . "\njeff dietert , an analyst at simmons & co . , said enron management needs to continue to make clear the issues that have investors confused and concerned .\nin a worst - case scenario , investor fears could create a vicious cycle that continues to drive the stock down , which would force bond rating agencies to consider downgrades of enron . that could lead to lower credit ratings , which would force enron \' s energy trading partners to limit their exposure to the company and cut back on business with it .\n" thus , we see a big incentive for enron to clarify the issues , " dietert wrote in a report friday . " our gut feel is that enron can pull it off . "\nfeygin said he also believes the company will continue to do better in revealing its financial dealings but thinks there may be more surprises in store .\nfor example , a wall street journal article friday discussed for the first time another business entity with ties to enron known as chewco . it was formed in 1997 with about $ 400 million in financial backing to buy interests in unnamed enron assets .\nchewco was run by michael kopper , a managing director of enron \' s global equity markets group .\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .\nbusiness\nenron says microsoft breached contract\nstaff\n10 / 27 / 2001\nhouston chronicle\n3 star\n2\n( copyright 2001 )\nenron corp . filed suit against microsoft corp . in state district court in houston this week , claiming the software giant breached a contract over a new high - speed internet service .\nthe companies entered into an agreement last june in which enron would provide internet bandwidth to microsoft as it rolled out its msn broadband service . enron \' s broadband network would link msn customers in over two dozen states , including texas .\nqwest communications is providing the internet infrastructure in 14 other states for msn .\non oct . 23 , microsoft said that enron would have breached the contract if it didn \' t provide an operational bandwidth system by oct . 25 , according to bloomberg news . in the lawsuit , enron claims microsoft failed to deliver the ordering and billing system it needed to deliver its end of the project \' s first phase .\nthe lawsuit appears to be blocking the launch of the msn service in all but the 14 states served by qwest .\nenron officials declined to comment . a microsoft spokesman said the company had not reviewed the filing but was " confident that we have upheld our agreement with enron .

- tom ridge \' s announcement that \' \' the site where the letters were mailed \' \' had been found in new jersey - - proved a dead end . and now the president is posing with elementary - school children again .\ngiven that this is the administration that was touted as being run with c . e . o . clockwork , perhaps it should be added to the growing list of things that have changed forever since sept . 11 . but let \' s not be so hasty . not everything changes that fast - - least of all washington . the white house \' s home - front failures are not sudden , unpredictable products of wartime confusion but direct products of an ethos that has been in place since jan . 20 .\nthis is an administration that will let its special interests - - particularly its high - rolling campaign contributors and its noisiest theocrats of the right - - have veto power over public safety , public health and economic prudence in war , it turns out , no less than in peacetime . when anthrax struck , the administration \' s first impulse was not to secure as much cipro as speedily as possible to protect americans , but to protect the right of pharmaceutical companies to profiteer . the white house \' s faith in tax cuts as a panacea for all national ills has led to such absurdities as this week \' s house \' \' stimulus \' \' package showering $ 254 million on enron , the reeling houston energy company ( now under s . e . c . investigation ) that has served as a bush campaign cash machine .\nairport security , which has been enhanced by at best cosmetic tweaks since sept . 11 , is also held hostage by campaign cash : as salon has reported , servicemaster , a supplier of the low - wage employees who ineptly man the gates , is another g . o . p . donor . not that republicans stand alone in putting fat cats first . in a display of bipartisanship , democrats - - lobbied by linda hall daschle , the senate majority leader \' s wife - - joined the administration in handing the airlines a $ 15 billion bailout that enforces no reduction in the salaries of the industry \' s c . e . o . \' s even as they lay off tens of thousands of their employees .\nto see how the religious right has exerted its own distortions on homeland security , you also have to consider an administration pattern that goes back to its creation - - and one that explains the recent trials of poor tom ridge .\nmr . ridge is by all accounts a capable leader - - a successful governor of a large state ( pennsylvania ) who won the bronze star for heroism in vietnam . a close friend of george w . bush , he should have been in the administration from the get - go , and was widely rumored to be a candidate for various jobs , including the vice presidency . but after being pilloried by the right because he supports abortion rights , he got zilch . instead of mr . ridge , the administration signed on the pro - life john ashcroft and tommy thompson - - who have brought us where we are today .\nthe farcical failures of these two cabinet secretaries are not merely those of public relations - - though mr . thompson often comes across as a chamber of commerce glad - hander who doesn \' t know his pants are on fire , and mr . ashcroft often shakes as if he \' s not just seen great caesar \' s ghost but perhaps john mitchell \' s as well . both have a history of letting politics override public policy that dates to the start of the administration . they \' ve seen no reason to reverse their partisan priorities even at a time when the patriotic duty of effectively fighting terror should be their no . 1 concern .\npre - sept . 11 , mr . thompson , in defiance of science , heartily lent his credibility to the bush administration \' s stem cell \' \' compromise \' \' by going along with its overstatement of the viability and diversity of the stem cell lines it would deliver to researchers . post - sept . 11 , he destroyed his credibility by understating the severity of the anthrax threat , also in defiance of science . now he maintains that the $ 1 . 5 billion the administration is requesting to plug the many holes in our public health system - - almost all of it earmarked for stockpiling pharmaceuticals , not shoring up local hospitals - - is adequate for fighting bioterrorism . this , too , is in defiance of all expert estimates , including that of the one physician in the senate , the republican bill frist .\nit should also be on mr . thompson \' s conscience that for the first two weeks of the anthrax crisis he kept the federal government \' s house physician - - david satcher , the surgeon general and a much - needed honest broker of public health - - locked away , presumably because dr . satcher , a clinton appointee , became persona non grata in the bush administration for issuing a june report on teenage sexuality that angered the religious right . only after mr . ridge arrived on the scene was the surgeon general liberated from the gulag .\nas for mr . ashcroft , he has gone so far as to turn away firsthand information about domestic terrorism for political reasons . planned parenthood , which has been on the front lines of anthrax scares for years and has by grim necessity marshaled the medical and security expertise to combat them , has sought a meeting with the attorney general since he took office but has never been granted one . this was true not only before sept . 11 but , says ann glazier , planned parenthood \' s director of security , remains true - - even though her organization , long targeted by such home - grown talibans as the army of god , has a decade \' s worth of leads on \' \' the convergence of international and domestic terrorism . \' \'\nms . glazier found the sight of mr . ashcroft and other federal keystone kops offering a $ 1 million reward for anthrax terrorists a laughable indication of how little grasp they have of the enemy . \' \' religious extremists don \' t respond to money , \' \' she points out . such is the state of the f . b . i . , she adds , that one agent told a clinic to hold onto a suspect letter for a couple of days \' \' because we have so many here we \' re afraid we \' re going to lose it \' \' ( perhaps among the timothy mcveigh documents ) .\nif either the attorney general or the secretary of health and human services inspired anything like the confidence that , say , mayor giuliani does , there wouldn \' t have been a need to draft mr . ridge . even so , he \' s mainly a p . r . gimmick - - a man who should have been in the administration in the first place reduced to serving as a fig leaf for lightweights . as director of homeland security , he \' s allegedly charged with supervising nearly 50 government agencies - - so far with roughly a dozen staff members . when asked to define mr . ridge \' s responsibilities , ari fleischer said on wednesday that it was \' \' a very busy coordination job , \' \' but so far mr . ridge is mainly sowing still more confusion .\nthe one specific duty that he has claimed - - in an interview with tom brokaw - - was that he \' d be the one \' \' making the phone call \' \' to the president to shoot down any commercial airliner turned into a flying bomb by hijackers . that presumably comes as news to donald rumsfeld , who made no provision for any homeland security czar in the air force chain of command he publicly codified days after mr . ridge \' s appointment .\nsince the administration tightly metes out the news from afghanistan , we can only hope that the war there is being executed more effectively than the war here - - even as mr . rumsfeld and his generals now tell us that the taliban , once expected to implode in days , are proving viet - cong - like in their intractability . the wall street journal also reported this week that \' \' instead of a thankful afghan population , popular support for the taliban appears to be solidifying and anger with the u . s . growing . \' \'\nmaybe we \' re losing that battle for afghan hearts and minds in part because the bush state department appointee in charge of the propaganda effort is a c . e . o . ( from madison avenue ) chosen not for her expertise in policy or politics but for her salesmanship on behalf of domestic products like head & shoulders shampoo . if we can \' t effectively fight anthrax , i guess it \' s reassuring to know we can always win the war on dandruff .\ndrawing\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .\ncity - enron directors cash in shares .\nby simon english .\n10 / 27 / 2001\nthe daily telegraph\np 31\n( c ) telegraph group limited , london , 2001\nleading executives at enron , the troubled us energy giant , cashed in shares worth more than $ 100 m ( # 70 m ) this year in the run - up to a financial crunch that has left the company \' s credibility in ruins .\nresearch by thomson financial shows that kenneth lay , chief executive , sold about 400 , 000 shares this year , netting him more than $ 25 m . he still held 2 . 8 m shares until july .\nother executives made similar sales , a revelation likely to anger investors who have seen the shares fall from $ 83 at the start of the year to $ 45 by july . they halved again this week and fell to below $ 16 yesterday . enron declined to comment on the share sales .\nmr lay said in a statement that he is seeking to " dispel uncertainty in the financial community " by drawing on lines of credit to restore faith in enron \' s financial strength . enron will pay off debts of $ 2 . 2 billion and keep another $ 800 , 000 in cash . he said : " we know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community .

- the independence of california \' s power transmission grid operator and its electricity sales to the state department of water resources came under fire at a house of representatives hearing thursday .\nbut grid operators said there was no way that arms - length transactions with the department of water resources could have been negotiated beginning in january when power blackouts were imminent and the state was the only buyer with money .\nrep . doug ose , r - sacramento , chairman of the house governmental affairs energy policy panel , charged in a prepared statement to open the hearing that the cozy relationship between the dwr and the california independent system operator could result in the state forfeiting any claim to refunds for overcharges by power generators .\n" the state \' s interference into cal - iso has possibly cost californians billions of dollars in potential refunds , " ose said . " moreover , it represents a serious violation of the federal energy regulatory commission \' s regulations . "\nat issue is the fact that the iso is run by a five - person board appointed by the governor when , under federal law , it is supposed to be independent . additionally , the iso \' s biggest customer is the dwr , which buys power using state money to firm up power deliveries by utilities too cash - starved to buy it themselves .\nlast week , the ferc determined that the dwr would not be entitled to any rate refunds on its power contracts . in reaching that decision , the commission cited the agency \' s special access to information that gave it a competitive advantage over other purchasers .\nterry m . winter , iso president and chief executive officer , said that at the time the department of water resources began buying power in january under these unusual circumstances , there were no other buyers willing to step in to keep power flowing to homes and businesses .\n" that occurred because the market was not functioning , " winter said . " they were the only creditworthy purchaser purchasing power . "\nbut kevin madden , the regulatory commission \' s top lawyer , said the relationship between the iso and the department of water resources raises troubling questions .\n" dwr buying on behalf of the state is a market participant , " he said . " it shouldn \' t be in the iso control room . it shouldn \' t be allowed to cherry pick " among power sellers .\nmadden said he expects the commission to rule soon on whether the iso should be reconstituted to ensure its independence .\nthe bee \' s david whitney can be reached at ( 202 ) 383 - 0004 or dwhitney @ mcclatchydc . com .\nyou can see this story at :\ncopyright ? the sacramento bee', 'feature2': 'ham'}, 55: {'feature0': 'start date : 2 / 6 / 02 ; hourahead hour : 24 ;', 'feature1': "start date : 2 / 6 / 02 ; hourahead hour : 24 ; no ancillary schedules awarded . no variances detected .\nlog messages :\nparsing file - - > > o : \\ portland \\ westdesk \\ california scheduling \\ iso final schedules \\ 2002020624 . txt\n! ! ! general sql error .\ncouldn ' t update ; currently locked by user ' admin ' on machine ' nahou - trdts 5 ' .\ntable\n- - - - energy import / export schedule - - - -\n* * * final schedule not found for preferred schedule .\ndetails :\ntrans _ type : final\nsc _ id : ectstnw\nmkt _ type : 2\ntrans _ date : 2 / 6 / 02\ntie _ point : malin _ 5 _ rndmtn\ninterchg _ id : enrj _ ciso _ 3000\nengy _ type : firm", 'feature2': 'spam'}, 56: {'feature0': 'fw : re ivanhoe e . s . d', 'feature1': 'fyi , kim .\n- - - - - original message - - - - -\nfrom : frazier , perry\nsent : thursday , march 07 , 2002 2 : 25 pm\nto : lebeau , randy ; watson , kimberly ; abdmoulaie , mansoor\nsubject : re : re ivanhoe e . s . d\njust a couple of additional thoughts , the cost estimate for esd mods of $ 130 , 000 will typically be , about 25 % more . the e abdmoulaie , mansoor ; frazier , perry\nsubject : fw : re ivanhoe e . s . d\nhere is an estimate for the upgrade to the ivanhoe esd system . please keep in mind that the hp at the location has not been in operation for several years and if it is ever required , we may be looking a major expense for that , too .

dependent . we have a team of quality\nrisk management professionals as evidenced by the fact that it is the primary\nrecruiting ground for the rac team ( david port , oliver gaylard ) .\nbarry \' s role is much less hands - on now and he is not our candidate for the\nglobal products position - this will continue to be kevin sweeney . the role i\nsuggest for barry is the high level co - ordination of the operations team -\nhis energy , enthusiasm and ability to execute on a plan , combined with his\nconsiderable institutional knowledge , making a superior candidate difficult\nto find . frankly , i suggested steve young not for additional depth , but to\naddress the relationship issue that clearly exists - i do not belittle this\nissue , and while i don \' t think that anyone can point to any " prosecutable "\noffences that barry may have committed in recent history , his management\nstyle doesn \' t help to promote the view that he is totally impartial and\nobjective . i will say that he has always been open and frank ( very frank )\nwith me - indeed if mally and sweeney had been as open we may have had a\ndifferent story to tell on helsinki .\nas an aside , i have not been involved in or consulted on the \' world tour \' ,\nalthough i know that barry suggested this sort of thing to sally a few weeks\nback . i think it is great that brent price is involved , but we would be happy\nto contribute staff to this too .\nregards\nfernley\nto : fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect\ncc : rick buy , sally beck / hou / ect @ ect\nsubject : re : trading support operations -

dependent . evidence to this effect are , the fact that\nhe is your only candidate for the global products position , that someone from\nhouston has to be part of the " world tour " in europe ( brent price ) , that\nyour candidates for a senior interim operations head in helsinki was david\nport or richard sage , and that your suggestion for additional depth is steve\nyoung .\nfurther for the record , i believe that i am not the only one with whom barry\nhas a credibility issue -

philadelphia , pa\njointly sponsored by the\nwilliam and phyllis mack center on managing technological innovation ,\nwharton school\nmarketing science institute\nwharton e - business initiative ( webi )\nconference themes & objectives\ne - commerce is heading inextricably and rapidly toward an inevitable\nshakeout and consolidation that tends to characterize every major new\nindustry . this impact conference bringstogether a distinguished group of\nindustry and academic leaders to discuss what is required to survive the\ne - commerce shakeout , and what it takes to be a " winner " when the shakeout\nhits , full - force .\nshakeouts are spawned in the boom - and - bust environment of hot emerging\nmarkets . an unsustainable glut of competitors is attacted by the\ncontagious enthusiasm for the emerging technology . as competition\nintensifies and falling prices put pressure on margins there is a wave of\nailures and mergers that removes the weaker players .\nfew ecommerce markets - - whether e - tailing online exchanges or others - - - will\nbe exempted from the forces that cause shakeouts . this conference will\ncombine lessons from markets that have experienced shakeouts , with the\nlatest thinking about the unique features of e - commerce , to identify\nsuccessful strategies for surviving a shakeout .\nquestions to be addressed include :\n- are the patterns seen in previous shakeouts of high technology markets\napplicable to ecommerce ? what are the early warning signs of an impending\nshakeout ?\n- which ecommerce markets are most susceptible to a shakeout ? will there\nbe single or multiple winners ?\n- which companies are likely to survive ? what strategies will the winners\nuse ?\nthere is controversy and uncertainty about which factors will most\ncontribute to prospects for survival . how important are first mover\nadvantages and building brand equity ? what do incumbents have to do to\nprevail ? which business models are most robust ? how important is the\nability to manage strategic partnerships ?\nthese issues will be addressed with a program that encourages active\ndialogue and interaction and includes speakers from industry , academia and\nwall street .\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nagenda\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\ndinner co -

end to meet enron requirements for gearing ratios .\nwhilst this does not present undue problems for lme warrants , these being\nbearer documents , it does present an issue when physical metal , the value of\nwhich depends upon brand and location , is placed into the facility . given the\nhard deadline of year - end the operational support of this process initially\ntook place on spreadsheets .\nthe impact of the obsf on the operational side of the physical business\nshould not be underestimated . the process of moving material off and on\nbalance sheet places considerable strain from trading through to settlements ,\nparticularly when there is an absence of necessary control functionality in\nthe as 400 . with the specified functionality it is believed that all\noperational and trading issues arising from obsf can be managed\nsatisfactorily .\nthe core functionality , which was due prior to the year - end , was released\nduring january but was subsequently found to have introduced \x01 + bugs \x01 , to the\nintegrated business control processes . whilst an improvement on having no\nobsf functionality , the \x01 + bugs \x01 , have had an increasingly negative effect on\nthe control environment , compounded by the fact that it can not provide a\nguaranteed delivery for the \x01 + bug \x01 , fixes and non core \x01 , reporting \x01 ,\nfunctionality .\nthis has given rise to the following concerns :\n? there are insufficient experienced resources to fully reconcile stock at a\nbrand & location level to coordination records ( the global position is\nreconciled however ) .\n? it is not possible to substantiate the dpr for em & cl as :\n? a ) p & l on spread moves from cash to 3 months positions ( and related cash to\n3 months provisions ) can not be produced by the system and must be estimated ,\nand\n? b ) system bugs have created uncertainties over trial balance values .\nthese concerns are compounded by the following :\n? the most experienced as 400 it developer for the em & cl business has\nresigned . he is currently working his 6 months notice which will expire in\njuly 2001 .\n? the most experienced as 400 it developer on the eml side of the business has\nalso resigned . he left in january 2001 .\n? there is no documentation for the as 400 . it is therefore difficult for\nexperienced as 400 programmers to get upto speed on the system .\nconclusion\nit is essential that we do not become hostages to the development of the\nas 400 system and the renegotiation of the obsf facility with barclays . the\ncurrent situation has arisen due to non - delivery of it developments and tight\ntimescales on the finalisation of the obsf facility .\nto meet ql end requirements ( i . e . full production of the dpr and stock\nreconciliation ) , it and the obsf deal team must make concrete commitments on\ndelivery timeline . the business will not be able to commit to successful\nimplementation of the facility and resubstantiation of the trial balance\nwithout these\n- -

" the fees and which parties would be exempt remain undetermined , however , they would include a surcharge or a complicated calculation in which businesses would pay a percentage of future energy purchases . it is likely that whatever compromise legislators are able to reach regarding direct access , california \' s business community will have extreme difficulty accepting the terms .\nto ensure their efforts at resolving the direct access dilemma and abate fears of a collapsing state budget , lawmakers have gone so far as to introduce two bills , ( one sponsored by sen . bowen and defeated in july , and a second by assemblyman dave kelley , ) that would rescind language in previous legislation that authorized the public utilities commission to block direct access . the california puc has thus far stayed a decision on the matter , but is expected to rule by august 23 rd .\ncomplicating the issue is wall street . the state \' s bankers , led by j . p morgan , are nervous about selling as much as $ 13 . 4 billion in planned state bonds if businesses ( currently the largest ratepayers in the state , after governments ) find a way out of the system . the bonds are meant to repay the state for $ 8 . 2 billion in power - buying costs so far this year and to cover some future costs . business and residential electricity customers would repay the bonds through a surcharge on their utility bills . if businesses were allowed to sign on with outside energy providers , that revenue stream would be in jeopardy .', 'feature2': 'ham'}, 35: {'feature0': 'fw : re ivanhoe e . s . d', 'feature1': 'fyi , kim .\n- - - - - original message - - - - -\nfrom : frazier , perry\nsent : thursday , march 07 , 2002 2 : 25 pm\nto : lebeau , randy ; watson , kimberly ; abdmoulaie , mansoor\nsubject : re : re ivanhoe e . s . d\njust a couple of additional thoughts , the cost estimate for esd mods of $ 130 , 000 will typically be , about 25 % more . the e abdmoulaie , mansoor ; frazier , perry\nsubject : fw : re ivanhoe e . s . d\nhere is an estimate for the upgrade to the ivanhoe esd system . please keep in mind that the hp at the location has not been in operation for several years and if it is ever required , we may be looking a major expense for that , too .

line gc data is used as pipeline quality of gas in panhandle lateral because gs report from owens corning delivery point is quite similar to agave gc , 2 ) gas temperatures will become nearly the same as ground temperatures which is provided on scada at p - 1 and p 2 3 ) pressure and temperature profiles on the panhandle lateral at 6 / 14 , 9 : 00 am flowing conditions are listed below\nthe following graph ( attached in ms word ) is a phase envelope using the agave red bluff gas analysis . by mapping the above relative pressure / temperature points it is clearly observed that pipeline pressure and temperature conditions approach and cross the hydrocarbon dewpoint line indicating that liquids would exist .\nthe graph clearly shows that as the pressure and temperatures move further into the envelope the more liquids will be produced . that explains why more liquids are produced by pigging sections between cs p - 2 and cs p - 3 . furthermore , using the process model used to generate the phase envelope , the model indicates that gas at 800 psig and 65 degf would exist in both vapor and liquid phases . using a flow rate of 100 mmcfd the liquid phase fraction would be approximately 80 bbls . per day that could amount to approximately 2400 bbls . per month . this liquid volume compares closely to some of the recovery volumes reported by randy and walt below .\nlets get together on a conference call to further discuss findings and possible solutions . for a first stab , how about tuesday , 6 / 19 , at 8 : 00 am ( cst ) ? reply with availability and number of ports required . ef 713 / 853 -
